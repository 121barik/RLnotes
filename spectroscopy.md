# Spectroscopy

## Intro

Each element has a unique atom absorption spectrum

3 kinds
1. Absorption spectra: Light source is behind a gas and a gas absorbs it and scatters certain wavelengths and leaves dark lines in the spectrum of star
2. Emission spectra: Element is the light source and specrtum will be all dark except for a few wavelengths
3. Thermal spectrum: For a hot solid you can only figure out how hot it is 


For a hot gas you can look at the entire spectrum - emisison spectrum
Star is a combination of thermal and absorption spectrum

## Why do we get the lines?
Electrons exist in discrete energy state levels. It's 3 dimensional because electron cloud is 3 dimensional
Each level has one extra wavelength, shorter wavelength -> higher frequency


The reason we see black lines is electron absorb a wavelength and then scatter it in a different random direction (that we wouldn't be observing in the case of absorption spectra but we would be observing in the case of emission spectra)

Sorted by increasing energy: Lyman series, Balmer series, Paschen series (for Hydrogen) - spectra of larger elements are more complex

## Fine and hyperfine structure
Fine: Dirac theory (relativity + lamb shift)
Hyperfine: Nuclear interactions

## Other forms of spectroscopy

There are other forms of scattering like
1. Rayleigh scattering: metals reflect, sky is blue, sunset is orange ->  vibration of electrons causing little energy loss
2. Raman scattering: Light shines on molecules and vibrates them
3. Brillouin scattering: light can lose or gain energy in the lattices of solids

## Applications
1. Composition of space objects
2. Redshift of distant space objects
3. Atmosphere of exoplanets
4. Chemical spectroscopy
5. Nuclear magnetic resonance
6. Lasers
7. Atomic clocks
