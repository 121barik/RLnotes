# Fourier Policy gradients
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06891.pdf

* Recast integral analyses with policy gradients as convolutions and turn them into multiplication
* Critic uses trigonometric functions and radial basis functions
* Up until this work policy gradient methods were either high variance or deterministic
* Summary of policy gradient methods with special mention to expected policy gradient
* Goes over basic properties of FT such as F(fg) = F(f) * F(g)
* Fourier transform from state, action space to frequency space (not sure what this means exactly)
*
