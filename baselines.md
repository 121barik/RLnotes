Has a bunch of RL algorithms hooked up to a bunch of environments. Most of them can't be visualized for some annoying reason
Environments for box 2d, roboschool etcc need to be downloaded seperately from open ai gym
Would be nice to show training in browser

It's possible to render open AI gym in the browser using 2 different techniques: http://kyso.io/eoin/openai-gym-jupyter
1. Save the video as a file and then read it using html video reader
2. Render the environment as an rgb array
