# Grokking Deep Learning

## Chapter 1-2
* Kind of painful to read, talks too much about a knob analogy

## Chapter 3
* I like how the author shoed how a neural net can take 1 to many inputs and how it can output stuff

## Chapter 3-12: pretty painful to read

## Chapter 13+
* Interesting concepts
    - Word embeddings
    - RNN
    - Federated learning
    - Automatic differentiation
