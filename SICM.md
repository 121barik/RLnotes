# Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics notes

Damn this book is hard. As such the below summary is not complete

## Chapter 1: Lagrangian mechanics
* Construct action function which lets you distinguish realizable motions from others in a system in a coordinate independent manner by being stationary there
* An action is an integral of a function  called the lagrangian along a path
* Lagrangian uses current state at coordinated + rate of change to derive new state
* If Lagrangian is independent of time it means there is conserved energy
* Symmetries means a conservation of quantities

## Chapter 2: Rigid bodies
* Kinetic energy of a rigid body = rotational + translational energy. Center of mass allows us to distinguish the two
* Potential energy depends on mass distribution
* Angular momentum is conserved if there are no angular torquests. Angular momentum is a self contained dynamical system

## Chapter 3: Hamiltonian Mechanics
* HAmilton equations specify the dynamics of a system as a first order ODE. They use phase space trajectories which are determined by an initial point in phase space
* If there is a symmetry of the problem that is naturally expressed as a cyclic coordinate, then the conjugate momentum is conserved. In the Hamiltonian formulation, such a symmetry naturally results in the reduction of the dimension of the phase space of the difficult part of the problem. If there are enough symmetries, then the problem of determining the time evolution may be reduced to evaluation of definite integrals (reduced to quadratures).

## Chapter 4: Phase Space Structure
* Surfaces of section of a typical Hamiltonian system exhibit a menagerie of features including fixed points, invariant curves, resonance islands, and chaotic zones. Integrable systems have much simpler surfaces of section. By adding small effects to integrable systems we get insight into how this complicated behavior emerges.
* The Poincaré–Birkhoff construction shows how the infinite number of periodic orbits on an invariant curve with rational rotation number that is characteristic of an integrable system degenerates into a finite number of alternating stable and unstable fixed points when the system becomes nonintegrable. This phenomenon is recursive, so we find that it develops an infinite hierarchy of structure: The region around every stable fixed point is itself filled with commensurabilities with alternating stable and unstable fixed points.


## Chapter 5: Canonical Transformations
* Different representations will be equivalent if the coordinate–momentum part of the transformation has a symplectic derivative
* 

##Chapter 6: Canonical Evolution
* The time evolution of any Hamiltonian system induces a canonical transformation: if we consider all possible initial states of a Hamiltonian system and follow all of the trajectories for the same time interval, then the map from the initial state to the final state of each trajectory is a canonical transformation.

## Chapter 7: Canonical Perturbation Theory
* The goal of perturbation theory is to relate aspects of the motions of a given system to those of a nearby solvable system. Perturbation theory can be used to predict features such as the size and location of the resonance islands and chaotic zones.
* In higher-order perturbation theory for the pendulum we discover the problem of secular terms, terms that produce error that grow with time.
