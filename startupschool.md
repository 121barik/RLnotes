## 9 business models and the metrics investors want
https://www.startupschool.org/videos/66

Don't blend metrics to keep yourself honest
For enterprise look at revenue and sizes of contracts
For consumer look at Compound monthly growth rate

* Enterprise: look at bookings (sum value of contracts), total customers and revenue. Letter of Intent is neither a booking nor a contract
* SAAS (sell subscription based license for cloud service): MRR, ARR, CAC, MRR CHURN. Look only at recurring numbers not one time transactions
* Usage based
* subscription: MRR, User churn, Paid CAC, MRR CMGR
* transactional (lots of fintech fall here): take a percentage from a transaction. Look at gross transaction volume, Net revenue, User retention and paid CAC
* marketplace (collects percentage of total transaction value): Gross Merchandise value, net revenue, Net revenue CMGR (compounded monthly growth rate), user retention, paid cac
* e-commerce: monthly revenue + all other consumer metrics
* advertising: DAU, MAU, percent logged in
* hardware: monthly revenue, CMGR, gross margin


Major issues in presentations
* Cumulative charts instead of monthly data
* Not labeling charts
* Changing y axis scale
* Showing only % gains instead of both % and absolute
