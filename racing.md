# Building a race car AI
In this chapter we'll be looking at building an agent in a racing game. The primary application we'll be looking at is building a superhuman AI to drive around the racetrack you'd be defining. The ideas in this chapter extend beyond video games and you'll be learning the foundations of self driving cars in this manner. Self driving cars contains many subproblems including sensor networks, electronics, SLAM algorithms and finally navigation algorithms. Everything you'll learn here will mostly be relevant for navigation algorithms that have as input some RGB camera and need to decide for example whether to move left, right, speed up or break.

If you end up finding the contents of this chapter inspiring, I'd highly recommend you try to build your own RC car using a 3D printer, an arduino microntroller and some small servo motors.

We will use
1. Critic model: continuous Q-learning (SARSA)
2. Actor model: policy gradient
