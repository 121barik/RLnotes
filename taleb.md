## On the difference between binary forecasts and real world continuous payoffs
* You don't eat forecasts but P/L
* A belief is equivalent to a payoff (reminds me of Vovk book)
* Risk management isn't about making the right forecasts it's about having a payoff function with a good shape as in protects you vs tale risks
* Brier score: MSE of the forecast, only works when you ignore the fat tails


## (Anti)Fragility and Convex Responses in Medicine
* We define as locally antifragile: a situation in which, over
a specific interval [a, b], either the expectation increases with the scale of the distribution or the dose response is convex over the same interval.
*  The shape ofadose response curve can determine the distribution of  S(x) given that we know the distribution of x (normal  distribution)
* In short, antifragility is second order effect (the average is the first order effect)
* Mild symptoms benefit less from medicine than severe symptoms but  both cases  will be affected by side effects
* Concavity in dose response curve means there will be risks

## The	Decline	of	Violent	Conflicts:	What	Do The	Data	Really	Say?
* Histiriography (historical studies over time) are flawed because of a few fundamental effects
* Fat tails
* Boundedness: population sizes were different
* Reliability of historical data: Censuses are flawed and have agendas
* Definition of an event: Counting deaths in a period needs to be normalized by the number of years
* Different units for the analysis: from quantiles, to raw numbers, to ratios to relative numbers


## Naval and Taleb
* Business where you are judged by your peers will rot over time (e.g: Academia) - you want to impress your accountant not your peers
