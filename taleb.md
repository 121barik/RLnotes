# Summaries of posts Taleb has on academia.edu

## On the difference between binary forecasts and real world continuous payoffs
* You don't eat forecasts but P/L
* A belief is equivalent to a payoff (reminds me of Vovk book)
* Risk management isn't about making the right forecasts it's about having a payoff function with a good shape as in protects you vs dangerous tail risks
* Brier score: MSE of the forecast, only works when you ignore the fat tails


## (Anti)Fragility and Convex Responses in Medicine
* We define as locally antifragile: a situation in which, over
a specific interval [a, b], either the expectation increases with the scale of the distribution or the dose response is convex over the same interval.
*  The shape of a dose response curve can determine the distribution of  S(x) given that we know the distribution of x (normal  distribution)
* In short, antifragility is second order effect (the average is the first order effect)
* Mild symptoms benefit less from medicine than severe symptoms but  both cases  will be affected by side effects
* Concavity in dose response curve means there will be risks

## The	Decline	of	Violent	Conflicts:	What	Do The	Data	Really	Say?
* Histiriography (historical studies over time) are flawed because of a few fundamental effects
* Fat tails
* Boundedness: population sizes were different
* Reliability of historical data: Censuses are flawed and have agendas
* Definition of an event: Counting deaths in a period needs to be normalized by the number of years
* Different units for the analysis: from quantiles, to raw numbers, to ratios to relative numbers


## Naval and Taleb
* Business where you are judged by your peers will rot over time (e.g: Academia) - you want to impress your accountant not your peers - you have a class of smart people with no accountability , intellectuals yet idiots.
* Circular citation rings that give each other nobel prizes
* You can't bullshit financial assets, just short it if you think it's not gonna work
* Macroecon is a branch of politics
* Hamurabi, architect who builds a building that collapses is put to death 
* Bitcoin genesis in Bob rubin trade (responsible for 2008 financial crisis)
* Banks historically have never made money, they reshuffle risk and get rich themselves
* Build censorship mechanism and give it to your enemy - negative golden rule, don't do unto others what you don't want them to do unto you not positive which is less robust
* NGOs just virtue signal. You can't fake scars
* Dynamic inequality is a better metric than static inequality
* You don't want to work with anyone capable of writing a good business plan - focus on product instead of presentation
* Engineers have skin in the game, people who win nobel prizes nope

## Statistical consequences of fat tails (Book)
* Kurtosis measures the tailedness
* ML estimate doesn't work for tails unless you have tremendous amounts of data
* PCA is useless
* Higher moments are useless
* Forecasting is different from making a bet
* Options can't be hedged
* Law of large numbers takes too long to happen in real life
* Most of the interesting theorems in probability are inequalities not equalities, mostly soviet (Chebyshev, Markov etc..)
* Analyzing tails needs to take into account how many tails a distribution has
* The ruin of others doesn't affect your own personal ruin - instead the sequence of your decisions and failures and success are a better predictor of your success
* Functions with fat tails have higher peaks
* Standard deviation of a time seriess have issues of comparison because earlier events have less sample points to draw from
* Standard deviation is differnet than mean deviation - to draw inferences better to use mean deviation
* Bayesian Shmaysesian
* ReLU generalizes to tails better
*
