# A very brief history of mathematics by Wolfram

By 2,000 BC there were modern versions of arithmetic problems including percentages
Egyptians knew about primes
Babylonians had large tables of reciprocals ```x``` and ```1/x```
Pythogaras had a cult that got ejected from Greece so they went to Italy
Math started with geometery and arithmetic
Babylonian were big on Predictions became about who will win battles, what's happening with the heavens, who will be king, what weather will be
Babylionian theory was shaken after realizing there was no solution to ```sqrt(2)```
Library of Alexandria and people like Euclid contributed 300 BC helped centralize knowledge from the babylonians and started composing a list of theorems
Plato was interested in math for philosophical reasons and policy decisions and even voting theory
Relationship between math and science wasn't always obvious. when something is true in math would it be true in real life? Plato believed you can reason in pure thought
Euclids elements is the second most published book of all time after the Bible. Higher mathematics even today involves reading Euclid in the original greek. Even abraham lincoln apparently kept a copy of elements with him while on war to sharpen his mind and debate better. Most of what Euclid said is still true, not the same for Aristotle
Archimedes started working with 3d geometry and estimated pie
Outside of geometry a new movement was started with logic and formal systems
Greeks changed their alphabet, their math was tied to it and it retarded the progress but ideas starting appearing independently in China and India
Then we had the invention of discrete math in china (hexagrams) and in India they developed the production rules of Sanskrit language
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism - wow
Representational notation, placevalue notation, i.e variables were introduced in 1200
Fibonacci introcuded arabic numbers in the west - main motivation was accounting for commerce
Fractals were invented around 1205 - the cosmati famous architects https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmati
Mid 1300s more symbols were introduced liek +, -, squareroot sign to make it more widespread
Diophantus had an understanding of linear equations but he had bad notation so it made his life more complicated even though Euclid did label his figures but that idea of naming things took a long time to make it to arithmetic until the invention of algebra
Solution to cubic equations became a great challenge of mathematics which spurred the need for complex numbers not quadratic equations
Logarithms were a big deal because they were a way to multiply numbers by using wood blocks as in turn it into addition - invented by John Napier
Descartes introduced coordinate systems
Probability theory was invented because of gambling - same characters were often also in number theory. Pascal triangle for e.g used for both probability and number theory
Galileo died on the same day Newton was born
Newtons insight was reasoning about the natural world with math, babylions had some ideas in astronomy but Newton was the one who really pushed this forward. Among other things Newton had to invent calculus
Leibniz wanted to solve contracts using logic, early computational contracts person
Leibniz had a more symbolic version of calculus - he was actually pretty bad at finishing his projects - did genealogy research to prove that a marriage was adequate
In the 1700 explosion of calculus euler, lagrange, laplace and work here looks fairly modern
Gauss was involved in land surveying so invented differential geometry and got interested in prime numbers
Math is not a deductive field, best mathematicians have done experiments
Galois invented group theory - hothead french activist
Grassman algebra
1830 let's abstractify from the real world to abstract ideas like curved spaces and numbers that don't commute
Riemman died young did stuff in differential geometry
Peano how can you formalize in axiomatic way, even wrote english like this
Cantor was studying convergence of trigonometric series - had to invent set theory and transfinite numbers - transfinite numbers hasn't found its application yet
Math textbooks for kids started in 1600 before that textbooks were mostly traded among merchants
Functions as independent entities started in the 1800s
Hilbert was criticized for removing the art from math
Poincare was obcessed by the 3 body problem and started thinking about phase space and from that invented topology. Invented topology, dynamical system theory, chaos theory
Hilbert wanted to feed programs axioms and get all of math out and then Godels incompleteness theorems came out and it shook everything


Hey SIMD,

I saw your job posting for Omniverse and wanted to express my interest. Omniverse is something I'd be happy to work on even in my spare time so I'd really like a chance to work with people that see the value of building complex simulators

I'm a Machine Learning scientist and Product Manager who has worked at Microsoft, NASA's JPL and I've been a researcher at UC San Diego and UC Berkeley. I know my math and code but I also know how to communicate with different stakeholders (I've worked on M&As at Microsoft when I was a PM) and work on well designed products that matter (I was the primary design lead for a next gen email ranker)

I'm very comfy with advanced math. Some examples are on my personal blog and others are in commercial products that have been shipped.

I've been programming in Python for about a decade, it's definitely my comfort language.

Last year I quit my job to work on yuri.ai which is a Reinforcement Learning training and debugging platform for roboticists and game developers so Reinforcement Learning is my jam. As marketing material I'm also working on a book which should be out later this year. A tentative list of chapters can be found here https://github.com/msaroufim/Robot-Overlord-Manual

If you have any questions about any of what I've said, please feel free to ask me tons of questions.

Thanks,
Mark
