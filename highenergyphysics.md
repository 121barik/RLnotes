Nteurino is not 0 but very close so it's difficult to measure exactly
Neutrinos themselves have a hierarchy

# Summary
1. CNN to classify and detect objects in small patches of images at most 50x50
2. Deploy as a service easily for scientists that workk at FERMI or LHC - needs to be non blocking
3. Heterogeenous compute, CNN is the first application but others like GNN could replace earlier parts of the stack
